# üß† Notion Task Runner [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/simeg/notion-task-runner/graph/badge.svg?token=QA0G9JV92I)](https://codecov.io/gh/simeg/notion-task-runner)

This project automates Notion page updates, exports and backups automatically.
It's easy to forget this exists ‚Äî that's by design. It just runs.

![Full Flow](full_flow.png)

## ü§ñ What it does

- Updates specific Notion pages based on custom logic.
- Triggers a full export of your Notion workspace.
- Waits for the export to finish and downloads the `.zip` file.
- Optionally uploads the file to Google Drive.
- Logs everything neatly so you can inspect things if needed.

All logic is broken up into tasks that can be run independently or together.

## üöÄ How to run

To start the process manually:
```bash
make run
```

This is the main entry point that kicks off the entire export/download/upload pipeline.

- `NOTION_TOKEN_V2` ‚Äì Your Notion integration token
- `NOTION_SPACE_ID` ‚Äì ID of the Notion workspace
- `EXPORT_DIR` ‚Äì Where the exported .zip file will be saved
- `GOOGLE_DRIVE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_SECRET_JSON` ‚Äì JSON credentials for Google Drive (optional)
- `GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID` ‚Äì Target folder in Drive for uploads (optional)

## üß™ Testing

You can run tests with:

## üìù Notes

- This project is intentionally hands-off.
- If it stops working, check logs or manually run `make run`.
- Scheduling is handled via GitHub Actions, so this runs automatically on a schedule.
