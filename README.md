# üß† Notion Task Runner [![Notion Task Runner](https://github.com/simeg/notion-task-runner/actions/workflows/notion-task-runner.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/simeg/notion-task-runner/actions/workflows/notion-task-runner.yml) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/simeg/notion-task-runner/graph/badge.svg?token=QA0G9JV92I)](https://codecov.io/gh/simeg/notion-task-runner)

This project automates Notion page updates, exports and backups automatically.
It's easy to forget this exists ‚Äî that's by design. It just runs.

![Full Flow](full_flow.png)

## ü§ñ What it does

- Updates specific Notion pages based on custom logic.
- Triggers a full export of your Notion workspace.
- Waits for the export to finish and downloads the `.zip` file to a temporary location.
- Uploads the file to Google Drive.
- Logs everything neatly so you can inspect things if needed.

All logic is broken up into tasks that can be run independently or together.

## üöÄ How to run

To start the process manually:

```bash
make run
```

This is the main entry point that kicks off the entire export/download/upload pipeline.

## üìù Notes

- This project is intentionally hands-off.
- If it stops working, check logs or manually run `make run`.
- Scheduling is handled via GitHub Actions, so this runs automatically on a schedule.
